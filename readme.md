# Typescript CEP Panel for Premier Pro Boilplate

Working but not complete, allows debugging/breakpointing the dom side with VSCode. Will work with other adobe stuff with minor tweaks.

Uses
- Browserify - Combines dom and cep js into single file, should allow you to use node modules...
- tsify - typescript to javascript
- bootstrap/sass for styles
- gulp to build stuff
